This is a fork of the original skribblio hints that went inactive as of a few years ago. The word data is now source from [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mvark/9e0682c62d75625441f6ded366245203)
Since the data is sourced differently, there is no difficulty or count measurement. However, the search does still work.
